# About me

I'm Di, a data engineer, Python developer and a mathematician at heart. 

I've had 4 years of work experience in software engineering and data engineering, mostly coding in Python (Django, Flask, boto3, etc), but can do a bit of node.js too. I've grown pretty good at SQL (in several dialects), and spent a lot of time in my 2nd job writing API design documentation, endpoints and tests. I am pretty comfortable with common AWS products, as well as a bit of Azure.

As I mentioned above, I am a mathematician at heart. I was and still am fascinated by stochastic processes, for example. Nowadays I occasionally play with machine learning models, and in my first job I wrote a risk score API based on a database of politically exposed individuals.

In my spare time, I like hiking, long-walks, classical music and cooking. Yeah, from Bach to Thai curries, I'm free to chat.
