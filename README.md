# About me

I'm Di Zhu, a Master student in data science, and a MSc in mathematics. I'm enthusiastic about dealing with data, and gaining insights from data. 

My study field is data mining, machine learning and NLP. I'm familar with the implementation of different algorithms and have hands-on experience in data extraction and storing in SQL databases. I used to use a lot of MATLAB to deal with numerical simulations, but now I mainly program in Python and R. I can use SAS too.

In my spare time, I like hiking, long-walking, music, and cooking. I love reading different topics of books too, from history to mathematics.
